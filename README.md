Machine learning researcher/engineer with experience in computer vision, time series data analysis and forecasting, and natural language processing. My passion is deep learning. I enjoy using AI to solve society's problems and laying the foundations of next-generation learning algorithms. Concerning the recent AI literature, I am particularly interested in online learning of recurrent neural networks, deep generative modeling, and reinforcement learning. :technologist: :robot: I have experience in academia and have had the opportunity to explore exciting R&D problems in diverse industries (oil & gas, finance, healthcare, identity & security). Every day, I strive to learn something new by reading research articles or implementing a new idea. I have been living in Japan for more than six years before moving to the UK. :japanese_castle: :guardsman: Please do not hesitate to contact me for any matter and let me know if I can help you. I am always happy to connect, talk, and exchange ideas with like-minded tech professionals and computer science and machine learning enthusiasts.
